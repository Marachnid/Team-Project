    Unresponsive Team Member Policy
    Initial Check-in: If a team member has been unresponsive for more than 2 days during an active phase of the project (assessed by weekday daily standup/meetings), another team member will @ them directly in our group chat
    
    Escalation: If there is no response for another day, the issue will be discussed with the team, and tasks may be reassigned as necessary
    
    Final Step: If the team member remains unresponsive for four days without prior notice, the team will notify Paula and reassign work

    Branching Strategy

    Branching Strategy: Each code update will be developed on a separate branch named according to the convention : [NAME]-[incrementing number] (or some other other identifier)
    
    
    Merge Requests: When a feature or fix is ready, a MR will be created and assigned to at least one team member for review based on availability
    
    
    Code Review:
    MRs must be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging
    Feedback should be constructive and changes/discussion must be made before approval
    
    
    Merging to Main:
    Branch can be merged after MR approval
    Main branch should always be in a deployable state
    No direct commits to main are allowed—EXCEPT for .md or other support files (not including user documentation)
    
    Workload Distribution
    Work will be allocated based on each team member’s expertise. Large tasks will be assigned at bi-weekly planning meetings, with the goal of keeping everyone’s workload balanced. Any concerns, adjustments, or small tasks will be handled in our daily check ins on Slack.
    Communications Process
    Daily Stand-ups: Brief updates in a daily slack thread on weekdays
    Bi-weekly Sprint Meetings: Plan and review our work
    Slack: Ongoing communication and questions between meetings.
    Email: As necessary
